            <h3>1. Agreement to Terms</h3>
            <p>
              These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you,
              whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) and all the
              contributors of the Djed Alliance (“we," “us," or “our”), concerning your
              access to and use of the Djed Stablecoin protocol, including its smart
              contracts (the "Smart Contracts") and the djed.one web interface (the
              “Interface” or "Site") (collectively, "Djed").
            </p>
            <p>
              You agree that by using Djed, you have read, understood, and agreed to be
              bound by all of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE
              TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING DJED AND YOU MUST
              DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.
            </p>
            <p>
              We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or
              modifications to these Terms of Use from time to time. We will alert you
              about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use,
              and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change.
              Please ensure that you check the applicable Terms every time you use Djed so
              that you understand which Terms apply. You will be subject to, and will be
              deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any
              revised Terms of Use by your continued use of Djed after the date such
              revised Terms of Use are posted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Djed is not intended for use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
              country where such use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would
              subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or
              country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to use the Protocol or the
              Interface from such locations do so on their own initiative and are solely
              responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws
              are applicable.
            </p>
            <p>
              All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside must have
              the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian
              to use Djed. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read
              and agree to these Terms of Use prior to you using Djed.
            </p>

              how such data is stored on blockchains and you accept the storage of such
              data on the blockchain.

              The Smart Contracts run autonomously on the blockchain and the operation of

              the underlying blockchain, including without limitation: changes in
              blockchain transaction fees, discontinuance of the blockchain, forks in the
              blockchain, blockchain congestion, frontrunning, 51% attacks.
            </p>

              Djed depends on oracles that provide price data to the blockchain. We do not
              operate the oracles. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any
              problems in the oracles, including without limitation: oracle delays,
              unavailability of the oracle, wrong data provided by the oracle.

              to change, revise, update, suspend, discontinue, or otherwise modify Djed at
              any time or for any reason without notice to you. You agree that we have no
              liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by your
              inability to access or use Djed during any downtime or discontinuance of the
              Site. Nothing in these Terms of Use will be construed to obligate us to
              maintain and support Djed or to supply any corrections, updates, or releases
              in connection therewith.
            </p>
            <h3>9. Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>
              You hereby accept the non-territorial self-sovereign and autonomous nature
              of Djed and waive any and all rights to, and hereby covenants not to, bring
              any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding in any jurisdiction, judicial

              or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible
              by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at
              any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay,
              or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any
              provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be
              unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is
              deemed severable from these Terms of Use and does not affect the validity
              and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture,
              partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as
              a result of these Terms of Use or use of Djed. You agree that these Terms of
              Use will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You
              hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form
              of these Terms of Use and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to
              execute these Terms of Use.
